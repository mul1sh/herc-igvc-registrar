# HERC IGVC Subdomain Factory

## Harness Every Resource for Commoditization In Global Value Chains . ETH SubDomains 

This project is heavily inspired from the tutorial described in detail and published as part of the corresponding blog article available on [Tenzorum Medium](https://medium.com/tenzorum-project/the-ultimate-ens-and-%C4%91app-tutorial-a4f2ede94b08).

The code has been extended (from the one described in the blog) with support for top level domains other then `.eth` like, for example, `.xyz`.

This project forms the blockchain backend for HERCIGVC Mainnet product with the frontend deployed [here](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmQ7X4fE2BkoqMp6faBJQokP9FVE1V4HQ6vpqwxTiJrp2y/).
